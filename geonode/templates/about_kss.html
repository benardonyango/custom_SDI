<p>	
The Kenya Soil Survey (KSS) is a department of <a href="" target="_blank">Food Crops Research Institute</a> (FCRI) at the Kabete Research Centre.
This department has the national mandate to carry out research on the genesis and distribution of the major soils in the country. 
Given its situation, KSS also offers soil testing and advisory services on the fertility management of soils to farmers. For a contact in KSS, please follow <a href="" target="_blank">this link</a>.
</p>
<p>
KSS maintains tons of data and documentation (reports) on the biophysical and social environment at varying scales and content details. This immense data will be made available through the <a href="#">KALRO GIS Portal (KGP)</a>.	
</p>
<p>
In 1992, KSS established a GIS lab to maintain, harmonise and manage its large datasets on soils and themes related to the natural resources. This lab is the home of the GIS-Kenya project funded by the <a href="" target="_blank">McKnight Foundation</a>. <br>Dr Peter Macharia presently heads KSS.
